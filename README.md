# Intellisense-Test
Take home Test
#Use the Kuberenetes API and create a simple command line tool to provide a table output which includes
#the following details:
● Name of deployments
● Images of each deployment
● Date deployment was updated
Extend the tool to give the difference between two namespaces to show when some services are missing
or running different image versions. Deploy to a second namespace and make a few changes to it so that
we can see the difference in output.
